# LIMT
LIMT is a web-based application that tracks a registered users daily caloric intake, as well as their daily weight. 
The logic here being that to lose 1 lb of weight, you must burn 3500 kcal; thus, if a user is accurately tracking
their caloric intake over time, we can determine a semi-precise TDEE for a specific user. This information
is valuable because although TDEE calculators exist on the web already, they are limited to the age, height,
and weight of users and science tells us that the metabolism is more complex than a simple formulaic
combination of these factors and every literal human body is unique.

This application was an idea I've had for some time and recently found myself with enough time to implement,
post-graduation.

The technologies used will be Java Springboot, MySQL, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap5 and likely some others as I
am planning to host it live once complete.
